# Standard Config

Hello there, welcome to my config repository. 

This is where I try to keep track of all the config files I require to recreate
the environment that I prefer to work in. There are quite a few things, that 
make life tolerable as a developer, and this is my attempt to try and recreate
their beauty each time I have to set up a new system. 

Here's the list of the best things in my environment:

- [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
- [i3status-rs](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust)
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [zsh+ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

A couple of other things that make it what it is: 
- [JetBrains Mono (Font)](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

... that's all for now, but this list is still a work in progress, and I'll update it 
as I go.
