# ZSH 

The ZSH configuration is actually dependent on a couple other external packages,
that haven't been covered by the Makefile.

Here's the list of software which should be installed manually, to ensure that
you can recreate ZSH functionality to the extent you require: 

- [OhmyZsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/)
- [Spaceship-Prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt)
